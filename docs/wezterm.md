## Description

The keybindings are designed to emulate the behavior of `tmux` within Wezterm. By using the `ALT + q` combination as the leader key, you can efficiently manage tabs and panes, switch focus, and adjust pane sizes with intuitive shortcuts.

> **Note:** The leader key is set to `ALT + q`, followed by the appropriate keybinding to trigger the desired action.
